# simple_hibernate_app

This web app demonstrates the core features of Hibernate ORM used in conjunction with the JPA to persist and retreive records from a database.

The Code is simplified to contain only the essentials and leave out complex or more specialized ORM techniques with Hibernate (In most cases this is sufficient for developing powerful applications) to preserve simplicity and encourage extensibility.

#Database Server - MYSQL

For this demonstration, the database used is MySql but given Database agnosticity of the ORM, it is expected that you can easily configure the application to work with any database without hassles.

All pull requests are welcome.
